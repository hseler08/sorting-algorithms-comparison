# sorting-algorithms-comparison
This repository contains implementations and performance comparisons of selected sorting algorithms, including both classical and custom variants. The project enables benchmarking different sorting strategies on identical datasets with a focus on execution time and efficiency.

Implemented Algorithms Insertion Sort - standard version Binary Insertion Sort - uses binary search to find the insertion point Quick Sort - divide-and-conquer based fast sorting Heap Sort - sorting via heap construction Drunk Student Sort - a slowed-down, randomized interpretation of insertion sort (for educational/fun purposes)

Features Execution time measurement Testing on: Randomized arrays Sorted arrays Reversed arrays

Project Goal To provide an educational platform for analyzing and comparing different sorting methods, including a humorous take on algorithmic inefficiency ("Drunk Student").
